This is a space where your voice matters, your feelings are valid, and your story deserves to be heard. Together, we can bring awareness, support each other, and start the journey toward healing. This website is all about having victims of AI generated content, to have a safe space to talk about their feelings, without fear of judgement. All victims can choose to stay anonymous, therefore having the ability to give their side of the story, without the fake version being known or coming in the way.
